# System UI Tech Sample _by_ ‹div›RIOTS

This is a _Technology Sample_ you can rely on to build your own Design System, based on React and a [System UI theme](https://system-ui.com/theme).

**Disclaimer**: _Technology Samples_ aren't comprehensive _Design Systems_ but showcases a given technology so you free to build you own solution upon it.

## Architecture

This _tech sample_ uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to implement its components with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The Tokens are following the [System UI theme specification](https://system-ui.com/theme), and are consumed in two flavors: [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

### Tokens

The Tokens are separated in different components:

- `typography`: fonts definitions
- `colors`: colors and variants
- `space`: relative and absolute spaces
- `sizes`: screensize breakpoints
- `shadows`: inset and outset shadows
- `radii`: border radius
- `border`: borders definitions
- `z-index`: z-axe indices

The [System UI tokens specification](https://system-ui.com/theme) allows you to define scales (like `font-sizes`, `radius`, _etc_) in arrays. You can also refer to previously declared values as _aliases_.

Your `tokens` should be organized by following the _key reference_ in the specification:

| Theme Key      | CSS Properties                                                                                                                                                           |

All tokens are declared in dedicated `*.ts` files in each tokens' components. They're then all exposed by the `all/index.ts` component file in a `theme` constant.

Your theme tokens can be imported anywhere with

```ts
import { theme } from '~/all';
```

## Components

This _tech sample_ exposes components in two flavor. They all use the same theme tokens imported as above, so your React components and your theme are not hard-linked together, and you can rely on the theme abstraction you're the most comfortable with.

Both [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/#style-your-ui) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#themeprovider) exposes a `<ThemeProvider />` JSX wrapper that take as theme argument a system-ui theme tokens definition:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <!-- Your component(s) here -->
</ThemeProvider>
```

To avoid the need of loading the `<ThemeProvider />` decorator in each components, we have overridden the _stories_ and _doc_ layouts in the `tui-utils` component.

```jsx
export const Layout = (props) => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <MdxLayout {...props} />
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

### Theme-UI

In the `tui-utils` component, the global theme as well as **all components variations** are loaded and merged in a common theme definition in the `variants.ts` file. This definition is then used by the `<ThemeProvider />` that decorates the different layouts.

### Creating theme-ui components

To add new theme-ui based components, you have to create a component with two files: your component itself, and a `variants.ts` file that declares the [theme-ui compatible components definitions](https://theme-ui.com/components).

Your component's `variants.ts` file have to be loaded in the `tui-utils/variants.ts` file to be used by the wrapped theme.

### styled-components

On the contrary of _Theme UI_, _styled-component_ doesn't declares variations at theme level, but let you customize your components' styles directly by using the theme definitions:

```jsx
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledButton = styled.button(
  ({ theme, primary = true, secondary, disabled = false, loading = false }) => {
    return {
      'font-size': theme.fontSizes[2],
      padding: `${theme.space[2]} ${theme.space[3]}`,
    };
  }
);

export const Button = () => <StyledButton />;
```

### Creating a _styled-components_ component

To add new _styled-components_ component, create a component that import the _styled-components_ core utils:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { ThemeContext } from 'styled-components';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    // Your component here
  );
};
```

## Stories

Stories are written in Storybook's [Component Story Format](https://backlight.dev/docs/component-story-format).

You can defined multiple stories for your components to visualize their variations:

```jsx
import { Button } from '../index';
import { layout } from '~/tui-utils';
export default layout;

export const primary = () => <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>;
export const secondary = () => <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>;
export const disabled = () => <Button disabled>Disabled</Button>;
export const secondary_disabled = () => (
  <Button variant="secondary" disabled>
    Disabled
  </Button>
);
```

Stories for the components are located in their `stories/` folder.

## Documentation

Documentation pages are decorated by a React layout using the [@divriots/dockit-react](https://github.com/divriots/dockit-react) helpers. See the `layout` component.

### Pages

Each component embed its own documentation in its `doc/` folder. You can use any web format for your documentation but we recommend you to write it with the [mdx](https://backlight.dev/docs/mdx) format, allowing you to embed your components live in the documentation.
